DRAGON BOAT
TRAINING CENTRE
Member’s Guidebook


Our Mission

We firmly believe that competitive team sports promote healthy personal development in youth and adults. These sports are also strong builders of community. Dragon boat racing is a team canoeing sport with large following in San Francisco. It is important as a competitive sport in its own right, and in that it is a major “gateway sport” to competition in other paddling or rowing disciplines. San Francisco has one of the largest populations of dragon boat paddlers in the Western Hemisphere. In other cities, training facilities have been built where modest populations of paddlers have produced internationally successful athletes and competitive programs which are highly involved in their communities. The Bay Area, despite its population of paddlers, lacks these things.

Our vision is to create a centre like many which exist in other North American cities:
- We want to provide all Bay Area paddlers with the freedom to train at a highly competitive level
- We want to provide a nucleation site for the development of a strong competitive paddling community in the Bay Area

A weekly email will be sent out to inform all members of filled and available slots for paddling.
For safety reasons, all paddlers are required to record the time they launch and return in the binder on-site and also online.

OFF SITE BOAT USE
Use of boats off site for races or other events is only permitted by written approval of the Board of Directors
The paddler using the boat off site is responsible for any damage that the boat incurs- you break it, you buy it.

EMERGENCY CONTACT INFORMATION
Contact 1: President - Yohei Rosen - 646-981-5959
Contact 2: Principal Site Leader
US Coast Guard: 415-399-3300

REQUIRED GEAR ON BOAT
BOATCAGE KEY

PFD
As per US Coast Guard law and insurance guidelines, all vessels must carry a PFD (type I, II, III, or V approved by US Coast Guard or California Law). PFDs will be made available to members on site. Youth paddlers (under age of 18) and novice paddlers (any paddler with 6 or fewer months of small boat experience or uncomfortable in open bay) are required to wear the PFD; inflatable PFD are not permitted for youth or novice members.

It is highly recommended that PFD be worn regardless of experience.

WHISTLE
All boats shall carry a whistle in case of emergency. Club PFDs have whistles attached. Those wearing their own PFDs are required to carry a whistle with them while on the water.

LEASH
Absolutely necessary. Prevents loss of boat and possibility of drowning secondary to boat loss.

DRY BAG WITH PHONE
Required to contact Coast Guard in case of emergency. Plus you can also take pictures and track workouts with it!

SHOES/FLIP FLOPS
Shoes must be worn on land to prevent any injuries while launching or carrying the boat.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
- Wear bright colors or high-visibility clothing on the water (ie. neon colored hats, reflective jackets, etc.)
- Water and a small snack to refuel
- Waterproof watch to comply with boat reservation

RESPONSIBLE BOATING
- By coast guard law, no paddler should be on the water under the influence of illicit drugs, alcohol, or any other substance or pharmaceutical which may impair judgement
- Paddlers should be aware of the limitations of their paddling ability and endurance, as well as additional limitations which might result from the weather (excessive heat, cold, wind, rain)
- Paddlers should plan their training appropriately
- Paddlers should check weather ahead of time to gauge suitable conditions for paddling
- Paddlers should be aware of shallow water, wooden and concrete extrusions around the creek, and all other possible obstacles and hazards
- Paddlers should stay at least 50ft away from the bird sanctuary opposite of Pier 80
- Docking near the sanctuary is not allowed
- No members shall venture beyond the end of Pier 80
- Boaters should be aware of the rules and etiquette of the water as specified for boaters by the California Coast Guard (link to it?). A copy will be posted in the boat cage

WINTER/EXTREME CONDITIONS
In the event of unusual cold, strong winds, heavy rain, or presence of thunder/lightening, a weather notice may be placed by email to all members on the email list. The Board of Directors reserves the right to cancel paddling sessions for your own safety.

SWIMMING AND SELF RESCUE
Paddlers are not allowed to use the facility if they do not exhibit proficiency in the swimming/huli recovery test. This is essential to determine whether the boaters are capable of self-rescue in the event of capsize while wearing clothes.

If they fail the test, they are welcome to retest after noticeable improvement.

PERMITTED TRAINING AREA
- Stay a minimum of 20 ft (one full boat length) away from shore and shallow water to prevent damage of boats
- Novice and youth paddlers may not venture beyond the 3rd Street Bridge unless accompanied by an experience guide
- Boats may not be taken across the Bay, North of the Bay Bridge, or South of Candlestick Point unless written permission is given

REPORTING ACCIDENTS & MISCONDUCT
Any accident involving a paddler which results in injury, serious endangerment, or significant damage to or destruction of a boat must be reported to ICDBTC. All paddlers involved must be prepared to provide all accurate information necessary to be properly reported to Jacka-Liquori and the Coast Guard. Officers of IDBTC should be contacted by phone as well as by email.
I didn’t include the thing about lights since we don’t want people out when it’s dark during the trial run/ first year?


OC HULI RECOVERY PROTOCOL

VISUAL THEORY











Before Flip							     After Flip





*Note* Hull of the boat is the axis of rotation


						
																					       After Huli Recovery (Original State)

1) Go through mental checklist:
A) Do you have paddle in hand?
If not, try to retrieve paddle without losing connection to boat or have paddling buddy get it for you.
B) How far off from shore are you?
Do not recover boat in shallow water near rocks since boat may be damaged in the recovery process.
2) Grab back iako with one hand and wrap free arm around hull of the boat
3) Push the iako up and over the hull of the boat so that the ama rests on the other side
Effectively, you are rotating the boat 180° with respect to axis of rotation
4) Swim over to the left side of the boat with the ama afloat
This is the side you will get back onto the boat since the ama will provide additional stability for reentry
5) With left hand on back iako and right hand on hull of boat, push yourself up onto the seat of the boat

BOAT HANDLING
Rigging, Carrying, & Launching Boats
Rigging
Iakos are labeled according to their specified boat. Front iakos are labeled with two bands while rear iakos are labeled with only one band.
The general rigging procedure is as follows but may vary from boat to boat:
- Boats are to be rigged on the stands provided
- Place stands outside of the boat cage in an open area
- Untie tie-down ropes then remove boat gently from its rack inside the boat cage
	- Be mindful of where the nose and tail are against the cage
- Avoid ramming boat into boat cage, trees, and other obstructions
- Place boat on stands (nose first and then tail) and go back in cage to retie tie-down ropes if shared with another boat
	- The rudder should never make contact with dry ground
- Take out iakos, ama, paddle, leash, PFD, whistle, dry bag, and waterproof watch with you
- Attach iakos to hull then ama (may vary from boat to boat)
- No rigging should require forcing or striking the boat
Carrying
When carrying boats, exercise utmost caution since they are extremely fragile and expensive. Inexperienced members should not carry any boat alone but, instead, should work in pairs. If a member does not feel comfortable carrying a boat by him/herself, please assist him/her out in launching the boat.
The OC-2 should be carried by at least two people. The OC-1 or other one-person raft can be carried balanced on the shoulder. To carry an OC-1:
- Ensure that stern of boat (with rudder) is facing in front of you
- With right arm hugging the hull of the boat near the center of mass and your left hand holding the back iako, rotate the boat counterclockwise onto your shoulder such that only the top side of the boat makes contact with your shoulder
- No boat should ever be balanced with the bottom (submerged side) resting on the shoulder
To carry the marathon canoe, the lifting technique is as follows:

Launching
All boats are to be launched from the beach. Paddlers are to adhere to the following protocol to avoid damage to the boats:
- Be aware of obstacles, rocks, soft mud, and other hazards that may cause injury
- Wade into the water until the rudder clears the bottom by four inches
- Place the boat in nose first, then gently lower the rudder, and then finally rest down the ama
- Enter the boat from the ama side only
See video for boat handling example: http://youtu.be/u47LgO48Q3U?t=30s 

Where to launch from on beach? Direction when current/wind?


Closing Up Boat Cage
Check to see that the boats are tied down and all other equipment is properly stored. Log the time that you leave the boathouse in the check in/out binder. Lock the boat cage and double check that the boat cage is locked before leaving.
BOAT CARE & MAINTENANCE
Treat the boat as if it they were your own. Months of fundraising efforts by the founding officers went into acquiring the boats for your use. Treat them with respect.
Before and after each use, check the boats for the following to ensure your own safety on the water:
- Integrity of joints between iako and hull as well as iako and ama
- Obvious dents and punctures
- Functional operation of rudder, integrity of rudder cables and pedals (especially rusting or fraying)
- Condition of seat and its attachment to the boat
If any damage is noted: 
- Log down the status of the boat in the check-in binder and inform the Board of Directors immediately
	- The Board of Directors will designate a qualified paddler to conduct the repair
- Tape a paper sign on the boat indicating the boat is out of commission for the time being
- The boat should not be used until it is fixed
After each use, the boats should be washed down and dried with a towel. Hang the towels on the provided rack to let them air out.
Regarding other paddling equipment (ie. PFD, paddles, dry bags, etc.), check for holes, rips, excessive wear+tear, and other damage before and after each use. If any damage is noted, log down the status of the equipment in the check-in binder and inform the Board of Directors immediately. They will designate a qualified paddler to conduct the repair.
- Fixing holes, rips, and tears of PFD or dry bags with tape is not a form of adequate repair; they should be stitched with thread
- If varnish on paddle is wearing out, recoat with polyurethane
