DRAGON BOAT
TRAINING CENTRE
Member’s Guidebook


Our Mission

San Francisco has one of the largest populations of dragon boat paddlers in the Western Hemisphere. In other cities, training facilities have been built where modest populations of paddlers have produced internationally successful athletes and competitive programs which are highly involved in their communities. The Bay Area, despite its population of paddlers, lacks these things.

Our vision is to create a centre like many which exist in other North American cities:
- We want to provide all Bay Area paddlers with the freedom to train at a highly competitive level
- We want to provide a nucleation site for the development of a strong competitive paddling community in the Bay Area

REQUIRED GEAR ON BOAT
BOATCAGE KEY

PFD
As per US Coast Guard law and insurance guidelines, all vessels must carry a PFD (type I, II, III, or V approved by US Coast Guard or California Law). PFDs will be made available to members on site. Youth paddlers (under age of 18) and novice paddlers (any paddler with 6 or fewer months of small boat experience or uncomfortable in open bay) are required to wear the PFD; inflatable PFD are not permitted for youth or novice members.

It is highly recommended that PFD be worn regardless of experience.

WHISTLE
All boats shall carry a whistle in case of emergency. Club PFDs have whistles attached. Those wearing their own PFDs are required to carry a whistle with them while on the water.

LEASH
Absolutely necessary. Prevents loss of boat and possibility of drowning secondary to boat loss.
Only one person on the OC2 should be leashed.

DRY BAG WITH PHONE
Required to contact Coast Guard in case of emergency. Plus you can also take pictures and track workouts with it!

SHOES/FLIP FLOPS
Shoes must be worn on land to prevent any injuries while launching or carrying the boat.

SPARE PADDLE
At least one member in each party should carry a spare paddle. Lash to boat with rubber straps.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
- Wear bright colors or high-visibility clothing on the water (ie. neon colored hats, reflective jackets, etc.)
- Bring water and a small snack to refuel
- Bring a waterproof watch

RESPONSIBLE BOATING
- Coast guard law forbids paddlers from being on the water under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or any other substance or pharmaceutical which could impair judgement
- Be aware of the limitations of their paddling ability and endurance, as well as additional limitations which might result from the weather (excessive heat, cold, wind, rain)
- Check weather ahead of time to gauge suitable conditions for paddling
- Be aware of shallow water, wooden and concrete pilings around the creek, and all other obstacles and hazards
- Stay at least 60 ft (3 boat lengths) away from the bird sanctuary opposite of Pier 80; docking near the sanctuary is not allowed
- No members shall venture beyond the end of Pier 80
- Be aware of the rules and etiquette of the water as specified for boaters by the California Coast Guard (link to it?). A copy will be posted in the boat cage

WINTER/EXTREME CONDITIONS
In the event of unusual cold, strong winds, heavy rain, or thunder/lightening, the Board of Directors reserves the right to cancel all paddling sessions by email notice

SWIMMING AND SELF RESCUE
Paddlers are not allowed to use the facility if they do not exhibit proficiency in the swimming/huli recovery test. This is essential to determine whether the boaters are capable of self-rescue in the event of capsize while wearing clothes.

PERMITTED TRAINING AREA
- Stay a minimum of 20 ft (one full boat length) away from shore and shallow water to prevent damage of boats
- Novice and youth paddlers may not venture beyond the 3rd Street Bridge unless accompanied by an experienced guide
- Boats may not be taken beyond Pier 80 unless given an exemption by the board

REPORTING ACCIDENTS & MISCONDUCT
Any accident involving a paddler which results in injury, serious endangerment, or significant damage to or destruction of a boat must be reported to ICDBTC and Kayaks Unlimited. All paddlers involved must be prepared to provide all accurate information necessary to be properly reported to Jacka-Liquori and the Coast Guard. Officers of IDBTC should be contacted by phone as well as by email.


OC HULI RECOVERY PROTOCOL

VISUAL THEORY











Before Flip							     After Flip





*Note* Hull of the boat is the axis of rotation


						
																					       After Huli Recovery (Original State)
														
***Do not recover boat in shallow water near rocks since boat may be damaged in the recovery process.
***Do not detach yourself from the ankle leash
																					       
0) If in the OC2, check to make sure your partner's okay.
1) Recover paddle. If you cannot quickly retrieve it then do not attempt to. Have your buddy retrieve it.
2) Orient boat nose into the waves.
3) Swim around boat to side opposite the ama. DO NOT DETACH LEASH
4) Reach over the boat, grab either iako, and pull the ama over to your side of the boat.
5) Climb back on to boat. Momentarily dipping down into the water can make pulling yourself up easier.
6) Leash will be wrapped around boat--detach, unwrap and reattach only when safe in calm water and leaning on the iako

BOAT HANDLING
Rigging, Carrying, & Launching Boats
Rigging
Iakos are labeled according to their specified boat. Front iakos are labeled with two bands while rear iakos are labeled with only one band.
The general rigging procedure is as follows but may vary from boat to boat:
- Boats are to be rigged on the stands provided
- Place stands outside of the boat cage in an open area
- Untie tie-down ropes then remove boat gently from its rack inside the boat cage
	- Be mindful of where the nose and tail are against the cage
- Avoid ramming boat into boat cage, trees, and other obstructions
- Place boat on stands (nose first and then tail) and go back in cage to retie tie-down ropes if shared with another boat
	- The rudder should never make contact with dry ground
- Take out iakos, ama, paddle, leash, PFD, whistle, dry bag, and waterproof watch with you
- Attach iakos to hull then ama (may vary from boat to boat)
- No rigging should require forcing or striking the boat
Carrying
When carrying boats, exercise utmost caution since they are extremely fragile and expensive. Inexperienced members should not carry any boat alone but, instead, should work in pairs. If a member does not feel comfortable carrying a boat by him/herself, please assist him/her out in launching the boat.
The OC-2 should be carried by at least two people. The OC-1 or other one-person raft can be carried balanced on the shoulder. To carry an OC-1:
- Ensure that stern of boat (with rudder) is facing in front of you
- With right arm hugging the hull of the boat near the center of mass and your left hand holding the back iako, rotate the boat counterclockwise onto your shoulder such that only the top side of the boat makes contact with your shoulder
- No boat should ever be balanced with the bottom (submerged side) resting on the shoulder
To carry the marathon canoe, the lifting technique is as follows:

Launching
All boats are to be launched from the beach. Paddlers are to adhere to the following protocol to avoid damage to the boats:
- Be aware of obstacles, rocks, soft mud, and other hazards that may cause injury
- Wade into the water until the rudder clears the bottom by four inches
- Place the boat in nose first, then gently lower the rudder, and then finally rest down the ama
- Enter the boat from the ama side only
See video for boat handling example: http://youtu.be/u47LgO48Q3U?t=30s 

Where to launch from on beach? Direction when current/wind?


Closing Up Boat Cage
Check to see that the boats are tied down and all other equipment is properly stored. Log the time that you leave the boathouse in the check in/out binder. Lock the boat cage and double check that the boat cage is locked before leaving.
BOAT CARE & MAINTENANCE
Treat the boat as if it they were your own. Months of fundraising efforts by the founding officers went into acquiring the boats for your use. Treat them with respect.
Before and after each use, check the boats for the following to ensure your own safety on the water:
- Integrity of joints between iako and hull as well as iako and ama
- Obvious dents and punctures
- Functional operation of rudder, integrity of rudder cables and pedals (especially rusting or fraying)
- Condition of seat and its attachment to the boat
If any damage is noted: 
- Log down the status of the boat in the check-in binder and inform the Board of Directors immediately
	- The Board of Directors will designate a qualified paddler to conduct the repair
- Tape a paper sign on the boat indicating the boat is out of commission for the time being
- The boat should not be used until it is fixed
After each use, the boats should be washed down and dried with a towel. Hang the towels on the provided rack to let them air out.
Regarding other paddling equipment (ie. PFD, paddles, dry bags, etc.), check for holes, rips, excessive wear+tear, and other damage before and after each use. If any damage is noted, log down the status of the equipment in the check-in binder and inform the Board of Directors immediately. They will designate a qualified paddler to conduct the repair.
- Fixing holes, rips, and tears of PFD or dry bags with tape is not a form of adequate repair; they should be stitched with thread
- If varnish on paddle is wearing out, recoat with polyurethane
